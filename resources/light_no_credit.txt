Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.
We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king.
There are darknesses in life and there are lights, and you are one of the lights, the light of all lights.
Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I'm gazing at a distant star. It's dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago. Maybe the star doesn't even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything.
There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.
Stars, hide your fires; Let not light see my black and deep desires.
Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.
In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.
When you light a candle, you also cast a shadow.
A man who seeks only the light, while shirking his responsibilities, will never find illumination. And one who keep his eyes fixed upon the sun ends up blind.
What is dark within me, illumine.
There are two kinds of light - the glow that illuminates, and the glare that obscures.
She was bendable light: she shone around every corner of my day.
DARKNESS CANNOT DRIVE OUT DARKNESS: ONLY LIGHT CAN DO THAT. HATE CANNOT DRIVE OUT HATE: ONLY LOVE CAN DO THAT.
WE CAN EASILY FORGIVE A CHILD WHO IS AFRAID OF THE DARK; THE REAL TRAGEDY OF LIFE IS WHEN MEN ARE AFRAID OF THE LIGHT.
FROM THE ASHES A FIRE SHALL BE WOKEN, A LIGHT FROM THE SHADOWS SHALL SPRING; RENEWED SHALL BE BLADE THAT WAS BROKEN, THE CROWNLESS AGAIN SHALL BE KING.
THERE ARE DARKNESSES IN LIFE AND THERE ARE LIGHTS, AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE LIGHTS, THE LIGHT OF ALL LIGHTS.
DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT. RAGE, RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT.
SOMETIMES WHEN I LOOK AT YOU, I FEEL I'M GAZING AT A DISTANT STAR. IT'S DAZZLING, BUT THE LIGHT IS FROM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. MAYBE THE STAR DOESN'T EVEN EXIST ANY MORE. YET SOMETIMES THAT LIGHT SEEMS MORE REAL TO ME THAN ANYTHING.
THERE IS A CRACK IN EVERYTHING. THAT'S HOW THE LIGHT GETS IN.
STARS, HIDE YOUR FIRES; LET NOT LIGHT SEE MY BLACK AND DEEP DESIRES.
BEAUTY IS NOT IN THE FACE; BEAUTY IS A LIGHT IN THE HEART.
IN THE SUNSET OF DISSOLUTION, EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED BY THE AURA OF NOSTALGIA, EVEN THE GUILLOTINE.
WHEN YOU LIGHT A CANDLE, YOU ALSO CAST A SHADOW.
A MAN WHO SEEKS ONLY THE LIGHT, WHILE SHIRKING HIS RESPONSIBILITIES, WILL NEVER FIND ILLUMINATION. AND ONE WHO KEEP HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE SUN ENDS UP BLIND.
WHAT IS DARK WITHIN ME, ILLUMINE.
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF LIGHT - THE GLOW THAT ILLUMINATES, AND THE GLARE THAT OBSCURES.
SHE WAS BENDABLE LIGHT: SHE SHONE AROUND EVERY CORNER OF MY DAY.
